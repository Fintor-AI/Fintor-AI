# 👋 Hi, I'm Hossein Asgari (Fintor AI)

**Algorithmic Trading Architect | MQL5 Developer | Python ML Engineer**  
Founder of **Fintor AI**, building modular, engineering-grade trading systems for Forex, Crypto, and multi-asset execution.

I design trading systems like aircraft:  
**modular · testable · resilient · risk-aware**

## 🔧 Core Specialties

### **Algorithmic Trading (MQL5 & Python)**
- Trend engines (MA-based, breakout, ATR, regime-aware)
- Grid & hedge recovery frameworks  
- Risk engines (exposure control, daily DD guard, ML-based filters)  
- Execution engines (smart routing, slippage protection, error handling)

### **Machine Learning for Trading**
- Pre-trade classifiers  
- Regime detection models  
- ML-driven guard layers (Safe/Balanced/Aggressive modes)

### **System Architecture**
- Clean modular EA design  
- Separation of UI / Inputs / Core Logic  
- Logging, monitoring, presets, backtest workflows

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

I don’t ship “black-box magic bots.”  
I build **systems**:

- deterministic  
- auditable  
- modular  
- extendable  
- failure-resistant  

My work is focused on bridging:
**classic quant engineering + modern ML + strict risk frameworks.**
